HXL hashtag chooser
===================

Python script to generate a static HTML page from a JSON-encoded knowledge HXL base.

# About HXL
The [Humanitarian Exchange Language](http://hxlstandard.org) (HXL) is a simple, hashtag-based standard that humanitarian-crisis responders can use to add interoperable information to spreadsheets and similar data. The HTML generated by this script is an interactive chooser that helps IM workers to choose the most-accurate and interoperable hashtags.

The latest chooser is available online at https://hxlstandard.github.io/hxl-hashtag-chooser/index.html

# Usage
Generate the HTML in the docs/ folder via the Makefile provided:

    $ make
    
Generate the HTML manually:

    $ python gen-chooser.py > docs/index.html
    $ cp style.css docs/style.css
    
# Knowledge base
The knowledge base for the chooser is in the file hxl-knowledge-base.json. Instructions on updating it will come soon.

# License
This script and the HXL knowledge base are released into the Public Domain. Use with good cheer.
